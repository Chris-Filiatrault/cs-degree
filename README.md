## Final project

OSS University is **project-focused**.
After you've gotten through all of Core CS and the parts of Advanced CS relevant to you, you should think about a problem that you can solve using the knowledge you've acquired.
Not only does real project work look great on a resume, but the project will also *validate* and *consolidate* your knowledge.
